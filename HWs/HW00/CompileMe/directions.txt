In the open file, named "terminal_command.cpp", 
there is a C++ program that outputs the command to
run a python program that is located in the file "run_me.py". 
Change the program to instead output to compile the C++ file 
named "compile_me.cpp". Be sure to use the arguments that 
Lab 00 teaches in order.

#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::cout << "python3 run_me.py";
}
