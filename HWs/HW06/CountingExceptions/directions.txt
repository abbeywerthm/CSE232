Counting Exceptions

In the file CountingExceptions/counter.cpp, you need to write a function named CountExceptions that takes a vector of strings and returns a vector of ints (size 3). The purpose of this function is to take a list of book titles and check that they are valid, according to the function named CheckName. The CheckName function takes a string and raises various exceptions if the name isn’t acceptable. The CountExceptions function should return a vector with the number of title that raised an invalid_argument, a length_error, or an out_of_range exception.

I’ve provided an example CheckName implementation and main function for local testing, however some of the test cases use a variation of CheckName that looks for different criteria to throw exceptions for. Be sure to use the appropriate header files. Be sure not to alter any files besides the counter.cpp file.
