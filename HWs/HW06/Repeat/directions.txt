In the files Repeat/header.hpp and Repeat/implementation.cpp, you need to a header and an implementation file for the function named Repeat. If repeat is called with an int, it should return the int doubled. If it is called with a char, it should return a string with that char used twice. If it is called with a string, it should return that string repeated twice (with a space character separating the two copies).

Example test case:

    CHECK(Repeat(45) == 90);
    CHECK(Repeat('c') == "cc");
    CHECK(Repeat("word") == "word word");

Your solution should not use any conditional statements, meaning no ifs nor any types of loops. Please ensure your solution doesnâ€™t include the words: if, for, and while.
